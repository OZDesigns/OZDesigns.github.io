# List of images for the site gallery. This file is in YAML format.
# See https://yaml.org/ for a complete manual on writing in YAML.
#
# In brief:
#
# * Comments start with a `#` on their own line (like this block).
# * Everything after the first three dashes on their own line begins
#   the actual contents of the file.
# * List items are denoted with a single dash (`-`). This file is just
#   one big list. :)
# * A list item can have multiple key-value pairs, separated by a
#   colon. For example `key: value`.
#
# For example, to add an image with the filename "example_image.jpg"
# to your gallery, and give it a caption of "Example Image" you would
# add the following to the bottom of this file:
#
#   -
#     image: example_image.jpg
#     caption: "Example Image"
#
# The dash on its own line indicates a new list item. The next line
# is indented, indicating it is part of the list item. On that line,
# the text `image` preceeding the colon indicates that the list item
# is a key-value pair. The key is `image` and the `image` key's value
# is `example_image.jpg`. A list item can have as many key-value pairs
# as you want. So, in this example, the next line is another key-value
# pairing, with a different key (`caption`) and a different value for
# that key (`"Example Image"`).
#
# Certain gallery item keys are recognized specially by your site
# templates. See the `README.md` file in the same folder as this file
# for more details about the specifics of each key and its meaning.
